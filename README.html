	<h1>Notes</h1>
	<p>The primary file is 22-PC-trober22 or 22-PC-cgussen and contains links to the other files included in the assignment. Canvas wouldn’t let me upload a folder so I had to upload each page as individual .html file. The links in the navigation bar work but the links in the footer don’t right now. Most of the page is either empty or filed with dummy text because we are not entirely sure how the final organization will look. </p>
